# TheMealDBDessertApp

The MealDB Dessert Recipes App is a mobile application that provides a collection of dessert recipes sourced from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) for users to explore and try out. It offers a variety of dessert options and allows users to view detailed information about each recipe.

Note: This is my first Swift project. Prior to working on this project, I had no experience with the Swift programming language. As such, the organization and clarity of the code could be improved with more time. Despite being a newcomer, I embraced the challenge and learned Swift while developing this app. I hope you enjoy exploring the dessert recipes as much as I enjoyed building this project!
