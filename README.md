## Notes
This is my first Swift project. Prior to working on this project, I had no experience with the Swift programming language. As such, the organization and clarity of the code could be improved with more time. I also did not have the time to make tests for the app.

Despite being a newcomer, I embraced the challenge and learned Swift while developing this app. I hope you enjoy exploring the dessert recipes as much as I enjoyed building this project!
